        It is said \'cleanliness is next to Godliness\'. Cleanliness determine our quality of life.
        It is at both the levels-personal hygiene and the surroundings. Everyone should wear clean
        clothes, drink clean water and wash himself properly by timely bathing. This practice will
        protect us from falling ill. We should keep our houses clean and sweep the littlest dirt
        into dustbins. Keeping surroundings clean is equally important. No garbage should be allowed
        placed at proper places. Litters and garbage should be dumped into them. If every individual
        pays attention to cleanliness whole world will be a cleaner place to live in, then we will
        be healthier, happier and richer.
